# Test Document

This is a test document to demonstrate the vector search capabilities.

## Section 1: Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data.

## Section 2: Vector Search
Vector search, also known as semantic search, uses embeddings to find similar content based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches.

## Section 3: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
RAG combines the power of large language models with the ability to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base.
